# GQL

This is a GraphQL client for Python 3.6+.
Plays nicely with `graphene`, `graphql-core`, `graphql-js` and any other GraphQL implementation compatible with the spec.

GQL architecture is inspired by `React-Relay` and `Apollo-Client`.

## Documentation

The complete documentation for GQL can be found at
[gql.readthedocs.io](https://gql.readthedocs.io).

## Features

* Execute GraphQL queries using [different protocols](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transports/index.html):
  * http
  * websockets:
    * apollo or graphql-ws protocol
    * Phoenix channels
    * AWS AppSync realtime protocol (experimental)
* Possibility to [validate the queries locally](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/validation.html) using a GraphQL schema provided locally or fetched from the backend using an instrospection query
* Supports GraphQL queries, mutations and [subscriptions](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/subscriptions.html)
* Supports [sync or async usage](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async/index.html), [allowing concurrent requests](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/async_advanced_usage.html#async-advanced-usage)
* Supports [File uploads](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/file_upload.html)
* Supports [Custom scalars / Enums](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/custom_scalars_and_enums.html)
* [gql-cli script](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gql-cli/intro.html) to execute GraphQL queries or download schemas from the command line
* [DSL module](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/dsl_module.html) to compose GraphQL queries dynamically

## Installation

You can install GQL with all the optional dependencies using pip:

    pip install gql[all]

> **NOTE**: See also [the documentation](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#less-dependencies) to install GQL with less extra dependencies depending on the transports you would like to use or for alternative installation methods.

## Usage

### Basic usage

```python
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.aiohttp import AIOHTTPTransport

# Select your transport with a defined url endpoint
transport = AIOHTTPTransport(url="https://countries.trevorblades.com/")

# Create a GraphQL client using the defined transport
client = Client(transport=transport, fetch_schema_from_transport=True)

# Provide a GraphQL query
query = gql(
    """
    query getContinents {
      continents {
        code
        name
      }
    }
"""
)

# Execute the query on the transport
result = client.execute(query)
print(result)
```

> **WARNING**: Please note that this basic example won't work if you have an asyncio event loop running. In some
> python environments (as with Jupyter which uses IPython) an asyncio event loop is created for you. In that case you
> should use instead the [async usage example](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/async/async_usage.html#async-usage).
