WebsocketsTransport
===================

The websockets transport supports both:

 - the `Apollo websockets transport protocol`_.
 - the `GraphQL-ws websockets transport protocol`_

It will propose both subprotocols to the backend and detect the supported protocol
from the response http headers returned by the backend.

.. note::
    For some backends (graphql-ws before `version 5.6.1`_ without backwards compatibility), it may be necessary to specify
    only one subprotocol to the backend. It can be done by using
    :code:`subprotocols=[WebsocketsTransport.GRAPHQLWS_SUBPROTOCOL]`
    or :code:`subprotocols=[WebsocketsTransport.APOLLO_SUBPROTOCOL]` in the transport arguments.

This transport allows to do multiple queries, mutations and subscriptions on the same websocket connection.

Websockets SSL
--------------

If you need to connect to an ssl encrypted endpoint:

* use :code:`wss` instead of :code:`ws` in the url of the transport

.. code-block:: python

    transport = WebsocketsTransport(
        url='wss://SERVER_URL:SERVER_PORT/graphql',
        headers={'Authorization': 'token'}
    )

If you have a self-signed ssl certificate, you need to provide an ssl_context with the server public certificate:

.. code-block:: python

    import pathlib
    import ssl

    ssl_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_CLIENT)
    localhost_pem = pathlib.Path(__file__).with_name("YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE.pem")
    ssl_context.load_verify_locations(localhost_pem)

    transport = WebsocketsTransport(
        url='wss://SERVER_URL:SERVER_PORT/graphql',
        ssl=ssl_context
    )

If you have also need to have a client ssl certificate, add:

.. code-block:: python

    ssl_context.load_cert_chain(certfile='YOUR_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE.pem', keyfile='YOUR_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_KEY.key')

Websockets authentication
-------------------------

There are two ways to send authentication tokens with websockets depending on the server configuration.

1. Using HTTP Headers

.. code-block:: python

    transport = WebsocketsTransport(
        url='wss://SERVER_URL:SERVER_PORT/graphql',
        headers={'Authorization': 'token'}
    )

2. With a payload in the connection_init websocket message

.. code-block:: python

    transport = WebsocketsTransport(
        url='wss://SERVER_URL:SERVER_PORT/graphql',
        init_payload={'Authorization': 'token'}
    )

Keep-Alives
-----------

Apollo protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the Apollo protocol, the backend can optionally send unidirectional keep-alive ("ka") messages
(only from the server to the client).

It is possible to configure the transport to close if we don't receive a "ka" message
within a specified time using the :code:`keep_alive_timeout` parameter.

Here is an example with 60 seconds::

    transport = WebsocketsTransport(
        url='wss://SERVER_URL:SERVER_PORT/graphql',
        keep_alive_timeout=60,
    )

One disadvantage of the Apollo protocol is that because the keep-alives are only sent from the server
to the client, it can be difficult to detect the loss of a connection quickly from the server side.

GraphQL-ws protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the GraphQL-ws protocol, it is possible to send bidirectional ping/pong messages.
Pings can be sent either from the client or the server and the other party should answer with a pong.

As with the Apollo protocol, it is possible to configure the transport to close if we don't
receive any message from the backend within the specified time using the :code:`keep_alive_timeout` parameter.

But there is also the possibility for the client to send pings at a regular interval and verify
that the backend sends a pong within a specified delay.
This can be done using the :code:`ping_interval` and :code:`pong_timeout` parameters.

Here is an example with a ping sent every 60 seconds, expecting a pong within 10 seconds::

    transport = WebsocketsTransport(
        url='wss://SERVER_URL:SERVER_PORT/graphql',
        ping_interval=60,
        pong_timeout=10,
    )
