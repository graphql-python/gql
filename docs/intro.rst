Introduction
============

`GQL 3`_ is a `GraphQL`_ Client for Python 3.6+ which plays nicely with other
graphql implementations compatible with the spec.

Under the hood, it uses `GraphQL-core`_ which is a Python port of `GraphQL.js`_,
the JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL.

Installation
------------

You can install GQL 3 and all the extra dependencies using pip_::

    pip install gql[all]

After installation, you can start using GQL by importing from the top-level
:mod:`gql` package.

Less dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GQL supports multiple :ref:`transports <transports>` to communicate with the backend.
Each transport can necessitate specific dependencies.
If you only need one transport you might want to install only the dependency needed for your transport,
instead of using the "`all`" extra dependency as described above, which installs everything.

If for example you only need the :ref:`AIOHTTPTransport <aiohttp_transport>`,
which needs the :code:`aiohttp` dependency, then you can install GQL with::

    pip install gql[aiohttp]

The corresponding between extra dependencies required and the GQL classes is:

+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Extra dependencies  | Classes                                                        |
+=====================+================================================================+
| aiohttp             | :ref:`AIOHTTPTransport <aiohttp_transport>`                    |
+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| websockets          | :ref:`WebsocketsTransport <websockets_transport>`              |
|                     |                                                                |
|                     | :ref:`PhoenixChannelWebsocketsTransport <phoenix_transport>`   |
|                     |                                                                |
|                     | :ref:`AppSyncWebsocketsTransport <appsync_transport>`          |
+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| requests            | :ref:`RequestsHTTPTransport <requests_transport>`              |
+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| botocore            | :ref:`AppSyncIAMAuthentication <appsync_iam_auth>`             |
+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::

    It is also possible to install multiple extra dependencies if needed
    using commas: :code:`gql[aiohttp,websockets]`

Installation with conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is also possible to install gql using `conda`_.

To install gql with all extra dependencies::

    conda install gql-with-all

To install gql with less dependencies, you might want to instead install a combinaison of the
following packages: :code:`gql-with-aiohttp`, :code:`gql-with-websockets`, :code:`gql-with-requests`,
:code:`gql-with-botocore`
