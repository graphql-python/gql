Introduction
============

`GQL 3`_ is a `GraphQL`_ Client for Python 3.6+ which plays nicely with other graphql implementations compatible with the spec.

Under the hood, it uses `GraphQL-core`_ which is a Python port of `GraphQL.js`_,
the JavaScript reference implementation for GraphQL.

Installation
------------

You can install GQL 3 using pip_::

    pip install --pre gql

.. warning::

    Please note that the following documentation describes the current version which is currently only available

After installation, you can start using GQL by importing from the top-level
:mod:`gql` package.
